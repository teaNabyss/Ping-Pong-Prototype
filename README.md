# 2D Paddle & Circles Game (Learning Project)

### This project is a small 2D game I created while learning the basics of game development.
The idea is simple:

- You can spawn circles anywhere in the window by clicking.

- A platform (paddle) sits at the bottom of the screen.

- You can move the paddle left (A) and right (D).

- The goal is to keep the circles from touching the bottom by bouncing them back up.

### This project was mainly an experiment to practice:

- Handling keyboard input

- Handling mouse input

- Basic collision detection

- Simple physics / movement

Putting these systems together into a working game

**It’s not meant to be a full game—just a playground to learn and try things.**
